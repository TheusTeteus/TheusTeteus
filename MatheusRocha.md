# ðŸ‘‹ Hello folks! Be welcome to my Github profile
## My name is Matheus Rocha
- ðŸ”­ Nowadays I'm working as programming analyst focused on task automations and internal processes solutions to companies. I'v been developing frontend projects using technologies such as HTML, Javascript, CSS and frameworks as well (Bootstrap and React). In addition, I've been using NodeJS to build up backend projects (servers, databases and APIs).
- I'm here to colaborate with ideas. Here we go!
